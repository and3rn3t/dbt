## 🎯 What This Enables

### Better Code Suggestions

Copilot now knows:

- ✅ Your project structure (dbt + Python + Jupyter)
- ✅ Your coding standards (Black, 88 chars, type hints)
- ✅ Your naming conventions (snake_case, stg_ prefix, etc.)
- ✅ Your file organization (data/, notebooks/, scripts/)
- ✅ Your sample data structure
- ✅ Your common patterns and workflows

### Contextual Assistance

When you ask Copilot to:

- Create a new notebook → It uses your standard structure
- Write a dbt model → It follows your SQL conventions
- Add a data loading function → It includes error handling and Path objects
- Create visualizations → It uses your preferred styles
- Write tests → It follows your testing patterns

## 📝 Example Usage

### In Code

Just start typing and Copilot will suggest code that follows your conventions:

```python
# Type: "def load_customer_data"
# Copilot suggests:
def load_customer_data(filename: str) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """Load customer data from raw directory.
    
    Args:
        filename: Name of the CSV file
        
    Returns:
        DataFrame with customer data
    """
    path = Path(__file__).parent.parent / 'data' / 'raw' / filename
    return pd.read_csv(path)
```

### In Chat

Ask Copilot for help:

```
"Create a dbt staging model for orders data following our conventions"
"Write a function to validate customer data with error handling"
"Generate a notebook for sales analysis using our standard structure"
```

### With Comments

Write a comment describing what you need:

```python
# Load sales data, clean it, and calculate monthly totals
# Copilot will suggest complete implementation following your patterns
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. GitHub Copilot Will Auto-Read

No setup needed! Copilot automatically reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

### 2. Reference in Prompts (Optional)

For better results, reference the patterns:

```
"Following the notebook structure in copilot-instructions.md,
create an analysis notebook for customer churn"
```

### 3. Use AI_WORKSPACE_CONTEXT.md

Copy relevant examples from this file when you need specific patterns.

## 🎨 What's Covered

### Python Development

- ✅ Black formatting (88 characters)
- ✅ Type hints for all functions
- ✅ Google-style docstrings
- ✅ Error handling with try/except
- ✅ Path objects instead of strings
- ✅ Pandas vectorized operations
- ✅ Data validation patterns

### dbt/SQL

- ✅ CTE-based structure
- ✅ Lowercase keywords
- ✅ One column per line
- ✅ Naming: stg_, mart_, int_
- ✅ Model documentation in .yml
- ✅ Data quality tests
- ✅ ref() and source() usage

### Jupyter Notebooks

- ✅ Standard structure (imports, config, load, analyze, save)
- ✅ Markdown documentation cells
- ✅ Clear visualizations with labels
- ✅ Data validation checks
- ✅ Results saving patterns

### Security

- ✅ Never hardcode credentials
- ✅ Use environment variables
- ✅ .env file handling
- ✅ Data privacy considerations
- ✅ .gitignore patterns

## 📚 Context Provided

Copilot knows about:

- Your sample data: `data/raw/sample_sales_data.csv`
- Your directory structure: data/, notebooks/, scripts/, dbt_project/
- Your libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, dbt
- Your tools: black, flake8, pytest, mypy
- Your patterns: Data loading, EDA, dbt models, error handling

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Keep Instructions Updated

Add to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` when you:

- Establish new coding patterns
- Add new libraries or tools
- Create reusable utilities
- Solve common problems
- Change conventions

### Add Examples

Add to `.github/AI_WORKSPACE_CONTEXT.md` when you:

- Create a useful pattern
- Write a complex function
- Build a new type of model
- Discover a helpful trick

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Be Specific**: "Create a staging model for customers" is better than "create a model"

2. **Reference Patterns**: "Following our error handling pattern, add retry logic"

3. **Iterate**: Start with generated code, then refine with more prompts

4. **Use Chat**: Complex tasks work better in Copilot Chat than inline

5. **Review AI Code**: Always review and test AI-generated code

6. **Learn Patterns**: Notice the patterns Copilot uses and adopt them
