## 🚀 Next Steps - Choose Your Path

### **PATH 1: Deep Dive into Demographics** 🏫

_Explore the 343 columns in the demographics dataset_

```python
# In a new notebook or cell:
demo = load_csv("s3k6-pzi2_20251006_114239.csv")

# Explore what's available
print("All columns:", demo.columns.tolist())

# Key areas to explore:
# - Programs (ELL, special ed, gifted)
# - Facilities (library, gym, labs)
# - Enrollment data
# - School characteristics
```

**Quick Analysis Ideas:**

1. **Programs vs Performance:** Do schools with more programs perform better?
2. **Facility Impact:** Does having science labs correlate with higher scores?
3. **School Size:** Relationship between enrollment and SAT scores
4. **Specialized Programs:** Compare magnet/specialty schools to regular schools

**Create:** `notebooks/demographics_exploration.ipynb`

---

### **PATH 2: Time Series Analysis** 📈

_Track trends over time_

**Fetch Historical Data:**

```bash
# Get SAT scores from previous years
python scripts/fetch_data_gov.py zt9s-n5aj --domain data.cityofnewyork.us --limit 1000

# Could also fetch:
# - Historical graduation rates
# - Multi-year attendance data
# - Funding changes over time
```

**Analysis Ideas:**

1. How have SAT scores changed over the last 5 years?
2. Which schools improved the most?
3. Which boroughs are trending up/down?
4. Impact of policy changes on performance

**Create:** `notebooks/time_series_education.ipynb`

---

### **PATH 3: Predictive Modeling** 🤖

_Build ML models to predict performance_

**What You Can Predict:**

- SAT scores based on school characteristics
- Which schools need intervention
- Success factors for high-performing schools

**Simple Model Example:**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error, r2_score

# Features: demographics, programs, facilities
# Target: total_score

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Train model
model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
print(f"R² Score: {r2_score(y_test, predictions):.3f}")
print(f"Mean Error: {mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions):.0f} points")

# Feature importance
print("Top factors:", model.feature_importances_)
```

**Create:** `notebooks/predictive_modeling.ipynb`

---

### **PATH 4: Geographic Visualization** 🗺️

_Map schools by performance_

**Install Mapping Libraries:**

```bash
pip install folium geopandas
```

**Create Interactive Maps:**

```python
import folium

# Create map centered on NYC
nyc_map = folium.Map(location=[40.7128, -74.0060], zoom_start=11)

# Add schools colored by performance
for idx, school in merged.iterrows():
    color = 'green' if school['total_score'] > 1400 else 'orange' if school['total_score'] > 1200 else 'red'
    folium.CircleMarker(
        location=[school['latitude'], school['longitude']],
        radius=5,
        popup=f"{school['school_name']}<br>Score: {school['total_score']}",
        color=color,
        fill=True
    ).add_to(nyc_map)

nyc_map.save('nyc_schools_map.html')
```

**Note:** You'll need to get lat/lon coordinates (available in some NYC datasets)

**Create:** `notebooks/geographic_analysis.ipynb`

---

### **PATH 5: Comparative Analysis** 🔍

_Compare with other metrics_

**Fetch Additional Datasets:**

```bash
# View available options
python scripts/list_nyc_education.py

# Fetch specific datasets:
python scripts/fetch_data_gov.py 7yc5-fec2 --domain data.cityofnewyork.us  # Math test results
python scripts/fetch_data_gov.py 7crd-d9xh --domain data.cityofnewyork.us  # Attendance
python scripts/fetch_data_gov.py ufu2-7gxi --domain data.cityofnewyork.us  # Graduation rates
```

**Merge and Analyze:**

```python
# Load multiple datasets
sat = load_csv("zt9s-n5aj_20251006_114228.csv")
attendance = load_csv("7crd-d9xh_*.csv")
graduation = load_csv("ufu2-7gxi_*.csv")

# Merge on DBN
combined = sat.merge(attendance, on='dbn').merge(graduation, on='dbn')

# Analyze correlations
print(combined.corr()['total_score'].sort_values(ascending=False))
```

**Questions to Answer:**

1. Does attendance correlate with SAT scores?
2. Are graduation rates a good predictor of SAT performance?
3. Do test scores predict college readiness?

**Create:** `notebooks/multi_metric_analysis.ipynb`

### **PATH 6: Build a Dashboard** 📊

_Create interactive visualizations_

**Option A: Plotly Dash**

```bash
pip install dash plotly
```

**Option B: Streamlit** (simpler)

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

**Simple Streamlit Dashboard:**

```python
# scripts/education_dashboard.py
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px
from scripts.utils import load_csv

st.title("🎓 NYC Education Dashboard")

# Load data
merged = load_csv("nyc_education_analyzed.csv", subfolder="processed")

# Sidebar filters
borough = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select Borough", ["All"] + merged['borough_name'].unique().tolist())
score_min = st.sidebar.slider("Min SAT Score", 800, 2400, 1000)

# Filter data
if borough != "All":
    filtered = merged[merged['borough_name'] == borough]
else:
    filtered = merged

filtered = filtered[filtered['total_score'] >= score_min]

# Display metrics
col1, col2, col3 = st.columns(3)
col1.metric("Schools", len(filtered))
col2.metric("Avg SAT", f"{filtered['total_score'].mean():.0f}")
col3.metric("Avg Test Takers", f"{filtered['number_of_test_takers'].mean():.0f}")

# Interactive scatter plot
fig = px.scatter(filtered, x='number_of_test_takers', y='total_score',
                 color='borough_name', hover_data=['school_name'],
                 title="School Size vs Performance")
st.plotly_chart(fig)

# Data table

### **PATH 8: Data Quality & Cleaning** 🧹

_Improve data quality_

**Check for Issues:**

```python
# Missing values
print(merged.isnull().sum())

# Outliers
from scipy import stats
z_scores = stats.zscore(merged['total_score'].dropna())
outliers = merged[abs(z_scores) > 3]
print(f"Potential outliers: {len(outliers)}")

# Data validation
assert merged['total_score'].between(600, 2400).all(), "Invalid SAT scores"
assert merged['mathematics_mean'].between(200, 800).all(), "Invalid math scores"
```

**Create Cleaning Pipeline:**

```python
# scripts/clean_education_data.py
def clean_education_data(df):
    """Clean and validate education data."""
    # Remove duplicates
    df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['dbn'])

    # Handle missing values
    df['total_score'] = df['total_score'].fillna(df['total_score'].median())

    # Validate ranges
    df = df[df['total_score'].between(600, 2400)]

    # Standardize names
    df['school_name'] = df['school_name'].str.strip().str.title()

    return df
```

**Create:** `scripts/clean_education_data.py` with tests in `tests/test_cleaning.py`
