# Jupyter Notebook Configuration

This file configures how Jupyter notebooks are handled in this repository.

## Setup

To enable better diff and merge support for notebooks:

```bash
# Install nbdime for better notebook diffs
pip install nbdime

# Configure git to use nbdime
nbdime config-git --enable --global
```

## Pre-commit Hook (Optional)

To automatically clean notebook outputs before committing:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install the hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Outputs**: Clear cell outputs before committing (except for documentation notebooks)
2. **Cell IDs**: Keep cell IDs stable when possible
3. **Execution Order**: Run "Restart & Run All" before committing
4. **Large Outputs**: Avoid committing notebooks with large data outputs

## Viewing Notebook Diffs

With nbdime installed:
```bash
# View diff in terminal
nbdiff notebook1.ipynb notebook2.ipynb

# View diff in browser
nbdiff-web notebook1.ipynb notebook2.ipynb
```
