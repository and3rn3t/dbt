## üí° Pro Tips

### **For Demographics Notebook:**

- Pay attention to the correlation visualizations
- Note which features have the strongest positive/negative correlations
- The text analysis reveals qualitative insights
- `ml_features_dataset.csv` will be used in the next notebook

### **For Modeling Notebook:**

- Random Forest often performs best (provides feature importance)
- Look at the residual plot to see prediction quality
- Over-performers are doing something right - investigate them!
- Under-performers may need additional support

### **For Dashboard:**

- Use filters to drill down into specific segments
- Try searching for famous NYC schools (Stuyvesant, Bronx Science)
- Compare boroughs to see educational inequality
- Export visualizations for presentations (right-click, save image)

# - s3k6-pzi2_*.csv (Demographics)
```

### **Import errors:**

```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
