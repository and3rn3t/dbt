## ✅ Successfully Cleaned 5,000 Seattle Police Records

**Date**: October 5, 2025  
**Status**: Complete

## What We Did

### 1. Data Collection

- **Fetched**: 5,000 records from data.gov (Seattle Police Reports)
- **Source**: data.seattle.gov (dataset: kzjm-xkqj)
- **API Token**: Used for higher rate limits (no throttling!)
- **Raw File Size**: 0.79 MB

### 2. Data Cleaning Pipeline

Created comprehensive cleaning workflow in `data_cleaning_pipeline.ipynb`:

#### Cleaning Steps Applied

1. ✅ **Column Name Standardization**
   - Removed special characters (`:@`)
   - Simplified computed region names
   - Result: Clean, readable column names

2. ✅ **DateTime Processing**
   - Parsed datetime strings
   - Extracted features: date, time, hour, day_of_week, month, year
   - Date range: September 19, 2025 to October 5, 2025

3. ✅ **Geographic Data Cleaning**
   - Converted lat/long to numeric types
   - Created `has_coordinates` flag
   - Result: 99.98% have valid coordinates (4,999 of 5,000)

4. ✅ **Text Field Cleaning**
   - Standardized addresses (uppercase, trimmed)
   - Cleaned incident types (title case)
   - Removed extra whitespace

5. ✅ **Category Creation**
   - Created high-level incident categories:
     - Medical: 3,485 (69.7%)
     - Fire/Alarm: 696 (13.9%)
     - Other: 501 (10.0%)
     - Vehicle: 126 (2.5%)
     - Rescue: 106 (2.1%)
     - Service Call: 86 (1.7%)

6. ✅ **Data Quality Scoring**
   - Created quality score (0-100)
   - Added `is_high_quality` flag
   - Result: 100% high quality records!

7. ✅ **Removed Unnecessary Data**
   - Dropped 5 computed region columns (mostly missing)
   - Removed duplicates: 0 found
